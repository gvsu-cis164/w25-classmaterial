  instructor) and good answers (as endorsed by the instructor).  The
  exact formula is not yet determined, but the extra credit will
  be capped at 1% of the overall course grade.

## Course Policies
This course is subject to the GVSU policies listed at
[http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/](http://www.gvsu.edu/coursepolicies/).

### General Course Policies
* Many assignments and activities will be completed on 
  [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/).
  Emailed code will not be accepted.
* All assignments should be turned in on PrairieLearn.
* Late assignments
  will generally not be accepted, except in very extenuating
  circumstances (e.g. extremely severe illness, etc.).  This is done
  as the goal of these is to make sure you are keeping up
  with the material.
  Any work done on an assignment
  after the posted due date and time will not be counted for credit.
* If health issues for you or someone you care for,
  longer term internet issues, childcare issues, etc.
  arise, please post a private Piazza note to the
  instructor ASAP so we can work together to
  identify a solution.
* There may be a need for changes to happen midsemester, so this
  information is tentative and the
  instructor reserves the right to modify course policies, the course
  calendar, due dates, number of assignments, etc.

### Programming Exercises
Roughly week there will be at least one programming excersie.
These programming exercises are designed to give you a chance to practice
and to reinforce the current material.
They will be completed on PrairieLearn.
The exact form they take will depend on the specific topic -- they may
be finishing certain tasks in a jupyter notebook, writing a small python
function, or completing some command line tasks.

### Tests/Quizzes (PrairieLearn)
There will be multiple small tests/quizzes 
that will be taken on [PrairieLearn](https://prairielearn.engr.illinois.edu/pl/))
and consist of both non-coding (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, etc.)
questions and one or more coding questions.

The room may be recorded during exams to ensure academic integrity.
By taking the exams you consent to being recorded.
Please reach out to the professor no later than the end of the first
week of class if you have concerns.

### Course Project
In lieu of a final exam, each student (individually or with
a partner) will complete a culminating project of your choice.
The goal for these projects is that it allows you to bring
together all of the knowledge and skills covered throughout
the course and to apply them to a discipline you find
interesting.  As the course project is a significant portion
of the overall course grade, this
The deliverables for the final project will be:

* A presentation delivered to the class during the final exam
  time period.
* A github repo containing:
  * a jupyter notebook with your project write-up, code, and results
  * any data necessary for your project
  * any other relevant scripts used for data processing

In addition to these deliverables, there will be 2 intermediate,
short, check-in assignments.

* Project Ideas:  A short list of 3 potential project ideas.
  Each idea only needs to be a 2-3 sentences.  This will be
  submitted in week 4 (exact due date TBA).  This is just
  to make sure you are thinking about the project -- you
  are free to choose an idea other than one of the 3 you
  submit.
* Project Check-in / Proposal:  A description of the
  chosen project and the work that has been done so far.
  There is no set amount of work that has to be done by
  this point, but there should be enough done to identify
  any early issues.  This will be submitted in week 9
  (exact due date TBA).  The purpose of this is to
  make sure that you:

  1. have not simply forgotten about the course project
  2. have started looking on the project
  3. have done enough work to determine the project is feasible

The final, completed course projects will be due at the start
of our scheduled final exam time.
In addition to your project, you are expected to be paying attention
to other student's project presentations and providing feedback
on their projects.

The project is your opportunity to show me what you've learned.  Combining
code from multiple online resources, having AI do your project,
or simply following a tutorial is not an acceptable project.
You'll be graded on the work you do and what you show me *you* can do.
Showing me what you can do is more important that creating a flashy project.
I will expect you to cite any resources you used, including where,
if at all, you took any code from, where the data came from, etc.

The intent is that this project is something you would be proud
to showcase during an interview.

### Academic Honesty Policies
All students are expected to adhere to the academic honesty standards
set forth by Grand Valley State University. In addition, students
in this course are expected to adhere to the [academic honesty
guidelines as set forth by the School of Computing and Information
Systems](https://www.gvsu.edu/computing/academic-honesty-30.htm).

Academic honesty is taken seriously.  The ultimate rule used in
this course is that the work you turn in must be fundamentally
your own work, not the work of others/AI.  You are expected
to fully understand all aspects of the work you turn in.
You are also expected to clearly cite any resources you use,
being specific about how/where they were used.
If you have any questions about what is allowed,
it is your responsibility to check with the instructor first.

For this course:
* **Programming Exercises**:  are to be completed individually.
  You may discuss the programming exercises in general with others,
  but you should not sharing/copying code.
* **Project**:  may be completed individually or with a
  partner.  While you can discuss your project idea in general with others,
  fundamentally the work you submit for you project must be your own.  If working
  with a partner, both partners are expected to understand the project and be
  capable of explaining it (and the expected projects for a pair will be more
  involved than a single person project).
* **Tests/Quizzes**:  Tests/quizzes are to be completed individually.
  Tests and quizzes are open-book and open-note, and you are free to look
  at general online Python documenation (e.g. the official python docs).
  You are free to look at any of our course materials and your programming exercises.
  You may not attempt to
  find or use a full solution to the problem
  (or a solution to a large component of the problem) online.
  Additionally, you can not
  discuss or share any portion of the exam with another
  individual (whether or not they are taking this class).  You are also
  not allowed to benefit from any other student that may have sought outside help.
  You are not allowed to receive outside help from anyone else
  nor use an AI on any portion of the exam (e.g. ChatGPT, etc. are not allowed).
  You are also not allowed to use any editors that use AI completion.
  Finally, you are not allowed to look for/use/benefit from any solution
  to either the whole problem or a subpart of a problem available online.
  Using any unauthorized resource will be considered an academic integrity
  violation and may result in disciplinary action up to failure in the course.

#### FAQs:
* Can I use ChatGPT, Google Co-pilot, or similar technologies? *No, the work you
  submit must be your own and all code should be written by you, so this would
  be considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I seek help through sites like upwork? *No, this would generally be
  considered an academic integrity violation*
* Can I have help from a tutor?  *You may seek help from a tutor, but the work
  you submit for projects in the end must be your own.  You may not consult
  tutors when taking exams.*
* Can I use sites like stackoverflow?  *Yes, this is allowed in this course
  on projects
  so long as you are not simply posting your entire problem and asking
  for a solution and that you do not look for or use a full solution to a large
  portion of the problem (regardless of whether or not you were the one asking).
  You must cite the stackoverflow posts you use in your code
  and the overall work on the projects must still be fundamentally
  your own work (e.g. if you are simply piecing together many
  different stackoverflow posts, the work will not be considered
  your own work*
* Can I use sites like Chegg?  *No, this would be considered an academic
  integrity violation, even if you were not the one posting the question*
* Can I use general online resources?  *That depends.
  Fundamentally, the work you turn in must
  be your own.  This means that heavily basing your solution on (or directly copying)
  code for a significant component (whether from a single site or many different
  sites) of a problem is not allowed.  Talk to me first.*

#### Regret Policy
I recognize that courses can be stressful and occasional lapses of judgement
occur where students commit an academic integrity violation and regret it shortly
after.  In order to create an environment where you can take responsibility for
your actions, this course will have a "regret policy".  Within 48 hours of
the due date for a project or within 48 hours of completing a
test/exam, you can withdraw your submission if after
contemplation you believe you may have committed academic misconduct.
To do so, you must inform me in via email or private Piazza
note within 48 hours of the due date including the following text:
> I wish to invoke the regret clause for [ASSESSMENT NAME].

Upon invoking the regret clause
1. You will need to meet with me so we can talk through what happened.  Maybe
   there are bigger issues outside of class that need to be dealt with, maybe
   this wouldn't have actually been an academic integrity violation.
   The point of this meeting is not to
   be scary or a punishment, it's to talk through what happened.
2. You will be withdrawing your submission and as such will
   receive a 0 on the entire assessment.
3. Because you made this decision of your own accord and withdrew your submission,
   this instance will not be considered an academic integrity violation and will
   not be reported to OSCCR (except when there is a clear pattern of repeated
   invocations of this clause).

I will not look at any submissions until 48 hours after the due date
or exam/test completion time.
If the 48 hours have passed and you have not informed me of
your desire to invoke the "regret clause" and I detect academic misconduct, it
will result in disciplinary action, up to failure in the course, and will be
reported to the Office of Student Conduct and Conflict Resolution.

## Equity and Inclusion
As an instructor, I strive to create an equitable and inclusive learning
environment in our class.  Please reach out to me if there is any behavior in
the classroom that makes you feel unwelcome in any way.  To the extent permitted
by law, I will keep this information confidential.

## Special Assistance
If there is any student in this class who has special
needs because of learning, physical or other disability,
please contact me and Disability Support Resources (DSR)
